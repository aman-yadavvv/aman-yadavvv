I’m passionate about building scalable, reliable, and automated systems. I enjoy bridging the gap between development and operations by working with **Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD workflows, and cloud platforms**.  

Automation, monitoring, and collaboration are the pillars of my workflow. I love experimenting with new DevOps tools, optimizing pipelines, and deploying cloud-native applications.
